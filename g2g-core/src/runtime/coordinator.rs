//! M18 β scaffolding — the pipeline coordinator (control channel only).
//!
//! Today's linear runners spawn source / transform / sink as
//! independent, spawn-and-forget futures. Mid-stream cross-element
//! coordination (allocation re-cascade β, Phase C per-branch /
//! per-input re-solve, a future mid-stream clock change) has nowhere to
//! live in that topology: each arm only sees its own two links. The
//! coordinator is the single task that will own that coordination
//! (`DESIGN-M16-workaround3-reconfigure.md` §9.4 β; R2: single-task
//! coordinator, not shared `Arc<Mutex>` on every element; R3:
//! out-of-band coordinator-channel, not in-band `PipelinePacket`s).
//!
//! This is Session B: the channel topology plus an observe-only
//! coordinator. No reconfiguration logic moves here yet, so the data
//! plane behaves exactly as before. Runner arms *report* the events the
//! coordinator will later act on; the stub only counts them. Session C
//! moves startup negotiation in; Session D adds α hooks; Session E turns
//! `CoordinatorEvent` into a real `Recascade` cascade.
